In class PersonWithJob, line 28:
    System.out.println("p1.equals(p2)? " + p1.equals(p2))
    will call equals method from PersonWithJob class and
    the result will be returned from the line number 18.

    Details:

    the result is false from the line number 18
    if(!(aPersonWithJob instanceof PersonWithJob) return false ---> this line will return the result which is false).

In class PersonWithJob, line 29:
    System.out.println("p2.equals(p1)? " + p2.equals(p1))
    will call equals method from Person class and the result
    will be returned from line number 18.

    Details:
    p1 is a PersonWithJob and therefore program won't go to the line 16

    the program will continue to go to the next check and then check the name
    of p1 and p2. So, the result will be returned true.
